## Deployment Information

### About Deployment

THE APPRENTICE Bingo is a Flask-based web application that requires a server to run. Here's what you need to know about deployment:

### Can I Use Vercel?

**No, Vercel is not recommended** for this application because:

1. This is a Flask application with server-side functionality, not a static site or serverless function
2. The multiplayer features require persistent connections and database access
3. Vercel is primarily designed for frontend applications and serverless functions

### Recommended Deployment Options

For proper functionality, especially for multiplayer features, we recommend:

1. **Traditional Web Hosting**:
   - Platforms like Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk
   - These support Flask applications with persistent server processes

2. **Virtual Private Server (VPS)**:
   - Services like DigitalOcean Droplets, Linode, or AWS EC2
   - Gives you full control over the server environment
   - Requires more technical knowledge to set up

3. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**:
   - Heroku, PythonAnywhere, or Google App Engine
   - Easier to deploy but may have limitations on free tiers

### Deployment Requirements

For the application to work properly when deployed:

1. **Database**: The application needs a database to store game data
2. **Environment Variables**: Set up environment variables for configuration
3. **WSGI Server**: Use Gunicorn or uWSGI in production (not Flask's development server)
4. **Persistent Process**: The server needs to run continuously
5. **Domain Name**: Optionally, set up a custom domain name

### Quick Deployment Guide

1. Choose a hosting provider (e.g., Heroku)
2. Set up a database (PostgreSQL recommended)
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy the application code
5. Set up a production WSGI server
6. Configure your domain (optional)

Detailed deployment instructions for specific platforms can be found in the project's `deployment.md` file.
