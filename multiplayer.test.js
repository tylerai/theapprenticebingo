/**
 * How to Test Multiplayer Functionality
 * 
 * Since multiplayer functionality requires real-time communication between multiple clients,
 * it's best tested manually using the following approach:
 * 
 * 1. Setup Testing Environment:
 *    - Run the application on a local server
 *    - Open multiple browser windows/tabs pointing to the application
 * 
 * 2. Test User Registration:
 *    - Register different users in each browser window
 *    - Verify that each user gets a unique ID
 * 
 * 3. Test Room Creation and Joining:
 *    - Create a game room in one browser
 *    - Join the room from other browsers using the room code
 *    - Verify all users appear in the room
 * 
 * 4. Test Synchronization:
 *    - Make changes in one browser (mark squares, change settings)
 *    - Verify changes are reflected in other browsers
 * 
 * 5. Test Conflict Resolution:
 *    - Have multiple users try to mark the same square simultaneously
 *    - Verify the application handles conflicts appropriately
 * 
 * 6. Test Disconnection Handling:
 *    - Close one browser window
 *    - Verify other users are notified
 *    - Reconnect and verify state is restored
 * 
 * 7. Test Host Migration:
 *    - Close the host's browser window
 *    - Verify a new host is assigned
 *    - Verify game continues without interruption
 * 
 * Tools for Automated Multiplayer Testing:
 * 
 * For more advanced automated testing of multiplayer functionality, consider:
 * 
 * 1. Cypress for End-to-End Testing:
 *    - Can open multiple browsers and simulate user interactions
 *    - Example setup:
 *      ```
 *      // cypress/integration/multiplayer.spec.js
 *      describe('Multiplayer', () => {
 *        it('synchronizes game state between clients', () => {
 *          // Open first client
 *          cy.visit('/');
 *          cy.get('#create-room').click();
 *          cy.get('#room-code').then(($code) => {
 *            const roomCode = $code.text();
 *            
 *            // Open second client in another browser
 *            cy.window().then((win) => {
 *              const newWindow = win.open('/', '_blank');
 *              cy.wrap(newWindow).as('secondClient');
 *            });
 *            
 *            cy.get('@secondClient').within(() => {
 *              cy.get('#join-room').click();
 *              cy.get('#room-code-input').type(roomCode);
 *              cy.get('#join-button').click();
 *            });
 *            
 *            // Test synchronization
 *            cy.get('#square-0').click();
 *            cy.get('@secondClient').within(() => {
 *              cy.get('#square-0').should('have.class', 'marked');
 *            });
 *          });
 *        });
 *      });
 *      ```
 * 
 * 2. Mock Socket Servers:
 *    - Create a mock socket server for testing
 *    - Simulate multiple client connections
 *    - Test server-side logic in isolation
 * 
 * 3. Playwright for Multi-Browser Testing:
 *    - Similar to Cypress but with better multi-browser support
 *    - Can test across different browser types simultaneously
